# Embedded formulas are in internal/formula/formulas/ (source of truth)
# The .beads/formulas/ directory is for user overrides only, not tracked in gastown repo
# Users CAN track .beads/formulas/ in their own projects - this gitignore only affects gastown

# Gas Town runtime (added by gt install)
# Note: .beads/formulas/ is explicitly ignored below - it was tracked before but is now
# redundant since internal/formula/formulas/ is the source of truth for embedded formulas
